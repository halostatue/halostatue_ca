So, I went to get a CPAP device yesterday. While waiting in the lobby of the
medical devices office in Mississauga, I flipped through their magazine
stack.<!--more--> This is what I found:

This is obviously old. The cut of the model's blouse is not recent—I'm one of
the least fashion-observant people in existence, but even I can recognise this.
More obvious is the model's hair style. Yeah, there's a few people who have
similar hair styles in 2007, but it's very uncommon, and never on magazine
covers at this point. So, when _was_ this thing published?

Eighteen years ago.

I expect to find old magazines in a medical office. It's a common thing these
days, right? But eighteen years? Isn't there a statute of limitations for
keeping around old magazines?
