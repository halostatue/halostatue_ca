So, I went back to the medical devices place to return the trial mask and buy
the permanent mask. I had to wait a while, so I dug through all of their
magazines.<!--more--> At first, it seemed that the September 1989 magazine I
found was the oldest:

A couple of minutes more digging yielded an older magazine, though, by five
months.

But I kept looking. Long before my appointment was ready, I found something
twenty-four years old:

[![December

But right under that one was one that was even older: Woman’s Day from
February 1982. Twenty-five years old, almost twenty-six.
