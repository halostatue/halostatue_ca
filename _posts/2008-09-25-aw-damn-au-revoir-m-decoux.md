[Guy Decoux][rip-guy-decoux], an extraordinary Rubyist, died earlier this month
in tragic circumstances.

He will be missed by the community. [\_why][why-on-guy] has some of the best
commentary on this. There's already talk of a permanent addition to Ruby in his
honour, $ABOUT.ts ("ts" was his email address), and Ruby Central is considering
naming something (possibly a grant) in his honour.
