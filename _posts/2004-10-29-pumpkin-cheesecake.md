<p class="p-summary">A perfect Thanksgiving dessert and it's far tastier than
pumpkin pie—and easier to make, too. I made this for Canadian Thanksgiving and
a work potluck, and have been asked for the recipe.</p>

## Notes

- You can reduce the cracking of a cheesecake by putting a pan of water in the
  oven at the same time as you bake it.
- This may be topped with caramelized sugar and pecans, as desired.
- For variety, add ½ cup pecan pieces to the ginger snap crust.
