title: Vacationing with the iPhone
---

This past August, my wife and I went out to Nova Scotia with my parents in their
RV[^the-bus]. I'll be uploading some of the better pictures I took to my Flickr
stream in the near future.

[^the-bus]: We call it "The Bus", since it's a 40-foot Mandalay with four
    slides, resulting in about 400 square feet of living space when parked.

My parents tell me that they have wireless access in a campground more often
than they don't. Of the campgrounds we went to this summer, exactly _three_ had
any Internet access at all, and only _one_ was reachable from where we were
parked.

Intrepid road warriors, we kept up with our email and other web browsing most
days through my iPhone. Even in Cape Breton on the Cabot Trail, we had decent
EDGE data signal through the Rogers network[^access]. For eighteen of our
twenty-two days away from Toronto, the iPhone was our only meaningful Internet
access. It performed like a champ. We even got tickets to see Neil Young at the
Air Canada Centre in December while rolling down the road.

My parents also use Microsoft Streets & Trips with an attached GPS for
navigation. More than once, the iPhone with its GPS and Internet connection (and
Google Maps) gave us better directions than Streets & Trips. There was one
notable incident where Streets & Trips put us in the Atlantic, but Google Maps
on the iPhone gave us the right directions[^directions].

The iPhone[^3g] is too small to be practical for extended use as your sole
access to the Internet. It is an excellent adjunct to a standard laptop or other
computer and I don't regret the purchase or contract at all. I have some ideas
on how a good web tablet might work, based on my use of the iPhone and a Tablet
PC, but I'm going to let them percolate a bit before I publish them.

[^access]: Our level of access was predicted to be minimal by some Haligonians
    on Segways, advertising for Aliant—a competitor.

[^directions]: This was in part because I used the _address_ and not the name.
    Google Maps showed the wrong location for [Lunenburg County Winery][lcw],
    but the right location for [Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, B0J 2E0][lns]. Go
    figure.

[^3g]: In 2008, this was certainly true. In 2014, especially with the iPhone 5S
    and iPhone 6, this is less true. It's even less true in 2025.
