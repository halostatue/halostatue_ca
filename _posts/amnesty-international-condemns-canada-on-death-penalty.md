title: Amnesty International Condemns Canada on Death Penalty
---

[Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.org/) condemned Canada as
[soft on the death penalty][soft]. I mostly agree with them, as the Conservative
government[^conservative] is back-pedaling. Canadians are still largely against
the death penalty, and support the idea that we should not extradite criminals
if they are to face the death penalty, and support the idea that we should
request clemency for Canadian citizens facing the death penalty in other
nations.

The Conservative party (formerly known as the Reform Party) are a bunch of
yahoos who would love to see it brought back and have come up with excuses as to
why they're backpedaling on forty years of precedent. They sound as awful as the
Republicans do south of us.

It's really too bad that Stephane Dion's Liberals are too lily-livered to come
up with real positions that the Conservatives can't respond to without sounding
like the yahoos they are. Or that **real** _Progressive Conservatives_ can't
stand up and take their party back from Stephen Harper's yahoos.

[^conservative]: The modern Conservative party in Canada, led by Stephen Harper,
    are less right-wing than American Republicans, but are substantially more
    conservative than the Progressive Conservative party they replaced.
