title: Summer 2006 European Rubyist Meetups
---

So while I was in Europe, I gave a talk to the [London Ruby Users Group][lrug],
met with some German Rubyists in Potsdam and Munich, and Erik Veenstra in
Amsterdam.

## 2006-07-10: London Ruby Users Group {#london}

I spoke on a number of things at the [London Ruby Users Group][lrug] meetup,
ranging from the Google Summer of Code, to the Toronto Ruby Users Group
hackathon, to PDF::Writer. It was a much larger crowd than I expected (about 25
people!), and I ran out of time. Someone — I do wish I had pulled out a pad and
written down his name — was kind enough to buy me a Scotch after my talk when
the group went to the pub. Thank you again, kind sir.

The slides for the talk have been lost to time and platform rot.

## 2006-07-13: Potsdam {#potsdam}

After a few days wandering around Berlin after the World Cup had completed, we
met with Hagen Overdick in Potsdam. Hagen used Ruby in his degree program and
his practicum study for the transformation of business model descriptions to web
sites, etc. He lives in Potsdam, just outside of Berlin, and we met him on the
evening of Thursday the 13th after we picked up our rental car (an Opel Zafira).
He showed us around the Sans Souci palace park built by the Austro-Hungarian
emperor Frederick II. Absolutely beautiful and a worthy trip. He was very
knowledgeable of his town and obviously likes it a lot. We made it back to the
car just before the rain came down on us (after what had been a very hot—35
°C—and humid day in the Berlin area) and stepped into a nice Italian restaurant
just as the deluge began. After a wonderful dinner, we drove Hagen back to his
apartment and went on our way to Dresden and ultimately family in Lohr am Main.

## 2006-07-18: Munich {#munich}

We were supposed to originally travel to Munich for the 15th, but as my
travelling companions (my fiancée and her sister and boyfriend) aren't
programmers and we were visiting with family in Germany, those plans changed,
which meant that I missed the Munich.rb meeting and could not meet up with Armin
Roehrl.

On the evening of the 18th we met up with Urban Hafner. Urban saved my iPod from
being useless on this trip by bringing his charger. (It had fully discharged and
would only charge through my laptop; the USB-based charger that I had brought
did not provide enough power for the iPod.) We met Urban near the fish fountain
on Marienplatz where he was wearing his Munich.rb t-shirt and went to a nice
Bayernisch restaurant east of Marienplatz. During dinner we learned that Urban
used Ruby to process his raw data for his bio-informatics degree (equivalent to
a master’s), although he was not asked that in his thesis defence.

My traveling companions are just computer users (not programmers at all!) and
have pleasantly been pleasantly surprised by how nice, friendly, and
well-rounded the Rubyists they have met have been.

## 2006-07-27: Amsterdam {#amsterdam}

Well, on the afternoon of the 27th of July for my only day in Amsterdam, I
checked my email and I had an email from the indomitable
[Erik Veenstra][veenstra] of [RubyScript2Exe][rs2exe] fame. The scheduling was a
bit tight, but we ate at what I consider the best pannekoeken (a Dutch pancake
that is the size of a small pizza and often topped similarly) restaurant in all
of Amsterdam, the Pancake House. Like the other European Rubyists we met, Erik
is a pleasant person with a great sense of humour and well-informed. My fiancée
was charmed by all of them that she met (Hagen, Urban, and Erik) and we had a
lot of fun. Anne-Marie and I were supposed to meet her sister at 9:30, but it
was closer to 9:45 when we managed it because we were enjoying our discussion
with Erik so much. Thanks for emailing, Erik. It was a lovely evening.

## 2006-08-07: Vacation Rubyist Meet Wrapup {#wrapup}

A general thank-you to the European Rubyists that I met. I really enjoyed
meeting you guys and hearing how you use Ruby. For those whom I didn't meet, I
plan on going back to Europe in a couple of years (I want to do a North American
trip for holidays next year) and I hope to meet you then. Otherwise, I hope to
see you at this October's RubyConf.
