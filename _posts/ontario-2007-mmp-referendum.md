In the fall of 2007, Ontario held a referendum on electoral reform alongside the
provincial general election. The proposal was to adopt Mixed Member Proportional
(MMP) representation[^mmp] to replace the existing first-past-the-post (FPTP)
system. The referendum failed, but these were my thoughts at the time.

[^mmp]: [Mixed-member proportional representation][mmpr] is a proportional
    representation scheme that was proposed for use in Ontario, but was
    [defeated][ontario] in a referendum that occurred at the same time as a
    general election.

## 2007-09-21: Ontario Votes—Voting Format Referendum {#voting-format}

There's a referendum going on in Ontario on how we will vote in the future.
Others summarize it far better than I can:

- [Spacing.ca — MMP Primer Part II][mmp2]
- [Spacing.ca - Web Resources for MMP][mmpweb]

I don't think that it's a bad system, but I am concerned about the reduction in
the number of geographically-bound seats (formally, districts, informally
ridings) from 107 to 90; I'd rather see us have 120 geographically-bound seats
and an _additional_ 29 "list" seats. I haven't really decided which way I'm
going to vote on it, but I am edging in favour of it. Still, it's interesting
stuff and if you're an Ontarian, you really need to vote on this.

## 2007-10-01: Andrew Coyne on Why Conservatives Should Support MMP {#andrew-coyne}

In the September 22, 2007 [National Post][np], [Andrew Coyne][coyne] wrote an
editorial in support of MMP, entitled
[Why conservatives should support proportional representation][coyne-mmp].

I disagree with Andrew Coyne on much of what he says and writes. I don't believe
the way he believes. He believes that Mike Harris was _good_ for Ontario (when
exactly the opposite has proven true). But he is absolutely right when he says:

> A Tory government…of Ontario would look much the same under Mr. [John] Tory as
> under [the Liberal government of] Dalton McGuinty. It would do much the same
> things, at much the same cost, with much the same results.

> Oh, Mr. Tory would fiddle at the margins—cut a tax or two, expand funding to a

> to think show the vast gulf between them. But they're not kidding anyone.
> Whoever wins, the forecast is for McGuintory governments, as far as the eye

> [The current voting system creates most of what we find in] Canadian

> much. McGuintoryism, in short.

I think that John Tory would be bad for the province (he keeps pretending that
he's like Bill Davis, but he's much more like Mike Harris), but that doesn't
mean that I think that Howard Hampton or Dalton McGuinty are _good_ for the
province. Something has to change; MMP may not be the best change, but we have
to _try_.

## 2007-10-01: Why I (Now) Wholeheartedly Support MMP {#wholeheartedly}

I've been doing some serious thinking about the referendum question facing
Ontarians this fall.

[Spacing Votes][spacing-votes][^spacing-votes-dead] has been quite useful in
distilling some of the issues and features of MMP (Mixed Member Proportional
Representation) as opposed to FPTP (first-past-the-post, the current system), as
evidenced by the earlier section of this post. They continue to do so with
[MMP Disproportionality, Part I (Local Seats)][mmp-disproportionality]; I'm
looking forward to part two. I have, however, been thinking about the "list"
seats versus geographically-based seats ("ridings") and come to the conclusion
that the problem isn't list seats, but ridings.

My office-place is an interesting example in this problem, in that the office is
in nominally in Oakville (it's at Winston Churchill and Dundas, right at the
very border between Oakville and Mississauga), but very few people live in
Oakville. A lot of people live west of the office, in Hamilton, St. Catharines,
or Burlington; a lot of people live in Mississauga proper. Some, like myself,
live in Toronto. I spend nearly ⅓ of my life away from where I live, and of the
⅔ that I'm at home, roughly ⅓ of it is spent sleeping.

So while I care about my neighbourhood's representation in parliament (both
federally and provincially), I also care about the places where I work and (at a
minimum) the transit corridor I travel to and from work every day. My concerns
are less about where I live than how I get to and from work, which means that
regional transit policies matter to me. I can't effectively and efficiently use
a transit system to get to work. (The local Go station is ~10 minutes from my
house, the train doesn't run _that_ often and even _less_ often coming home, and
the nearest station is still ~15 minutes from work by bus; my total commute by
car is under 35 minutes).

I care about how municipalities (who should be caring more about the local
rights and responsibilities) are being run over roughshod by the OMB and
developers and the province itself. Mike Harris did more damage to Toronto's
infrastructure through forced amalgamation and downloading than anyone else. He
also reduced our democratic representation by cutting the number of city
councillors from 57 to 44—the City of Toronto web site says this was adopted by
City Council, but I recall reporting at the time was that the adoption was at
electoral gunpoint, just like the almagamation itself.

In other words, 90% of my concerns aren't limited to my relatively small
geographic region of the Parkdale-High Park riding, and the concerns I do have
about Parkdale-High Park should be addressed through City Council and my local
councillor rather than my provincial representation.

Ultimately, I don't know that I care whether my representation is regional, and
even think that regional representation may be the oddity in today's world. As
such, I can only end up supporting MMP. It may not be perfect, and I may regret
supporting it in the future, but I don't believe that being held hostage to the
past in this case is a good thing.

**Update:** Reading a bit more, I have found another point that puts me in
favour of MMP. The claim is that regional ridings represent the will of the
people. This is only partially true, in that there are plenty of examples of
parties parachuting in "star" candidates. I think Ken Dryden was this way for
the federal Liberal party; while the people of his riding ended up voting for
him, he did not have to win his party's nomination for the seat.
