This begins John C. Welch's paean to the more famous of the creators of
_Dungeons and Dragons_. I haven't read a lot of them, but I really liked John's
and really think it's worth reading. [Wil Wheaton][wwdn] also has some really
cool things to say.

Like many other geeks, I grew up playing D&D. I don't remember exactly when I
first played, but I know that like Wil, it helped me survive with a few of the
other geeks at First Baptist Church School in Charleston, South Carolina. It
gave me a ready-made group of friends when we moved to San Antonio, Texas and I
was starting at Judson High School. I remember long hours of play with Travis,
Randy, and Von. We explored not only D&D, but various other games including
_Star Frontiers_.

D&D was one of the things that helped me survive at Boston University where I
knew no one (the other was an early exposure to the Internet of 1989, where IRC
channels were _numbered_, and I played my first MUD—largely based on a mix of
D&D and _Adventure_). Without D&D, there would be no _World of Warcraft_.

My favourite module to run as a DM has always been _Ravenloft_. At Boston
University, I played with a group of Monty Haulers (one of them had three _Wands
of Wonder_, fully charged, ok?) and they were quite cocky. They hadn't met
someone who could match them in using the rules. I boosted Strahd—a vampire as
nasty as they come, and the main villain of the module—to their power. He was
powerful enough to cast _Anti-Magic Shell_. This spell, for those of you not
familiar with D&D, nullifies _all_ magic in a radius of 14 feet for 60 minutes
and vampires can _only_ be damaged by silver or magic weapons of a certain
strength (+2, I think). What was left unsaid in the rules, and I made a call on,
was that vampires weren't powered by magic.

Strahd attacked them early on and devastated them by casting _Anti-Magic Shell_,
leaving them with no way to damage him. How did they drive him off? Through an
innovative use of their combined magical items. The wizard cast _Tensor's
Floating Disk_ and then used a _Ring of Telekinesis_ to invert it. They poured
five or six bottles of holy water into the inverted disk and then used
telekinesis to float the disk over Strahd's head. They dispelled the disk and
dumped the holy water on his head.

I ran _Ravenloft_ twice more with different groups, and always had a lot of fun.
I played more than D&D, getting into Cyberpunk and various super hero games (I
always thought _Villains and Vigilantes_ was the best), and kept playing until
just over ten years ago. But it was an important part of my life, and something
that I won't forget. And, as John said:

> Goodbye Gary, and thanks. My life wouldn't have been the same without you.
