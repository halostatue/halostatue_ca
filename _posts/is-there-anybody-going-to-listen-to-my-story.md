With John Lennon's "Girl" begins [Julie Taymore][taymore]'s latest film,
[_Across the Universe_][atu]. The film is visually rich, musically gifted, and
utterly confused. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed it. This movie is divisive, make
no mistake. [Rotten Tomatoes][rt-atu] marks it "Rotten" as of the date of this
post, as shown below. Only 51% of the critical reviews are positive. Look at
those reviews, though, and you'll see strong feelings for or against the film.

Disclaimer: I went to see this movie because my brother's in it, as a dancer
(when Max goes into the induction centre and is stripped to his boxers, Kenneth
is the first soldier to Max's right, and dances behind him; later, he is two
beds to the left of Max). I also didn't pay anything to see it (due to some
complimentary—or compensatory—tickets provided by the theatre for a screening of
_Pirates of the Caribbean_ that was interrupted by a 5-year-old).

I was prepared to hate the film, because going in you know it will take every
possible cliché that it can. Despite a very slow start and an often muddled
middle with the various characters flitting in and out of the film, the film
managed to keep me entertained for more than two hours, and came across as
relevant today, at least to me. This is art, but it's not high art. It's candy
on the order of _Moulin Rouge!_, but perhaps not as well executed in the end.
Still, if you enjoy the Beatles, enjoy in-jokes, and are prepared to accept a
caricature of the 60s (but what movie _isn't_ a caricature of an era), you will
probably enjoy this film.
