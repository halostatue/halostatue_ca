title: Eggplant Curry
---

<p class="p-summary">A wonderfully easy vegan curry recipe with eggplants and
zucchini. It's a variation on a ratatouille that I make, with a commercial
curry paste and raisins instead of tomato sauce and balsamic vinegar. Whenever
I've made this for a potluck, I've been asked to share the recipe.</p>
