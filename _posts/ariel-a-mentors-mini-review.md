title: "ARIEL: A Mentor's Mini-Review"
---

I was the mentor of Alex Bradbury's ARIEL project, which was submitted as
“Automated Wrapper Generation for Information Extraction” and was dubbed ARIEL
(A Ruby Information Extraction Library) after some discussion. Alex was great.
The program was great. The result he's produced is great—and I'm not the only
one that thinks so.<!--more-->

My biggest regret is that I have been so **insanely busy** that I don't think
that I've been able to give Alex[^alex] the amount of time he deserved as a
mentor. I only hope that the bits I was able to give him truly helped and didn't
just come across as koans because I was too busy to do much more than I did. But
Alex created something useful, and something that I believe he will continue to
work on—ultimately I hope that he will be able to attract others to help him
build on ARIEL. It's just a very cool technology that I think will help people
make sense of the static web in the transition toward a Semantic Web.

[^alex]: [Alex][asbradbury] has done well enough for himself despite my benign
    neglect. He now runs, among other things, the [LLVM Weekly][llvm-weekly]
    mailing list.
