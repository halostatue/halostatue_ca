I hate writing my own bio. This isn't because I am hesitant to talk about
myself — over the years I have earned enough confidence to be able to own my
successes, my failures, my good parts, and my bad parts. Writing a bio is hard,
because while I am not certain of anything, I am self-assured enough to
all-too-easily come across as arrogant or self-absorbed. There's a fine line.
All of this makes the _TL;DR_ version of my bio above both perfectly accurate
and bland.

I have been on or led a software development team for more than thirty years,
most of it working for Toronto[^immigrant]-area startups: Northern Labs (senior
staff developer since late 2024), Kinetic Commerce (director of platform
engineering 2014–2024), ClearFit (2013–2014), SurfEasy (2011–2013), EVault
(2004–2011), and Solect Technologies (1998–2001). Before that, I worked at
Vanguard Cellular (now owned by AT&T Wireless) in Greensboro, North Carolina and
Policy Management Systems Corporation (now owned by Computer Sciences
Corporation) in Columbia, South Carolina.

I have written free or open source software since 1990, adding rigour to my
commitment with my adoption of Ruby in 2002, when I first published a number of
packages that are now widely used across the Ruby ecosystem including
[color][halostatue/color], [diff-lcs][halostatue/diff-lcs],
[mime-types][mime-types/ruby-mime-types], [minitar][halostatue/minitar] and a
few other active gems. In total since 2004, I have published or assisted with
the development of 38 gems totalling nearly 3 billion downloads. While some of
those gems have been retired, I continue to maintain several. I have also
released and maintain several Elixir packages and Fish shell plugins.

I am a polyglot developer. In my career, I have shipped[^shipped] software in
more than forty[^forty] programming languages or dialects[^dialects] and can
comprehend several other languages to the point where I can read them well
enough to port the code to a language that I do know. (I have ported software
from Smalltalk to Ruby, but I don't count Smalltalk in my known languages
because I haven't shipped anything written in it). I use Elixir, Ruby,
TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Bash, and Fish on a weekly basis for work and
personal projects alike.

I am a development leader. I have been heavily influenced by Michael Lopp
([Rands in Repose][rir]) in how I approach my duties as a manager. I succeed
only when my team succeeds, and my team can only succeed when I treat them like
professionals and help them _grow_. While I love writing software, I have
discovered that I love building teams to deliver software _just as much_.

This is who I am, but it is not _all_ of who I am. It is my career, and through
job interviews I have had to explain this many times, so I know it best and can
explain it best. Beyond my career, I am a son, a brother, a husband, a
brother-in-law. I am an immigrant and an expatriate. I am a foodie, a serious
amateur chef, a Scotch snob and a coffee hater. I am a poet, an infrequent prose
writer, a voracious reader. I am a tennis player and a cyclist. I am a
traveller. I am vegetarian. I am a type II diabetic and a chocoholic.

I am unapologetically Canadian and progressive in my outlook. I am a straight
white cisgendered male (he/him) who tries to be aware of the privileges I have
and try to use them to make the world a better, fairer, _safer_ place. I have no
patience for people who say that empathy is a weakness.

[I am large, I contain multitudes][whitman].

## …this blog

It seems that every ten years or so, I relaunch my website, with the previous
relaunch in October 2014. I update infrequently -- not because I have nothing to
say, but because I've never been good at journaling and I generally let my
published software do my talking. I always intend to write more than I do.

When I write here, I will be writing about those things that interest me or that
matter to me. Often, that is software development, technology, and team
leadership, but not exclusively. There will be politics, recipes, concert
reviews, photography, poetry, and anything else that interests me. When I write
about software development, I might be writing about things I am learning or
packages that I have released or maintain.

I will neither run advertising, nor use affiliate codes. When I have written
software reviews in the past, I have been offered and accepted free copies of
the software in question. I may do so again, but I will not let any such
consideration direct my opinions and I will call out such consideration in the
review.

Unless otherwise called out, I do not represent my employers (past or present)
with what I write here. The opinions I express here are mine and mine alone.

### …the comments

Not here. Should I write something interesting enough to comment about, there
are places to discuss it. Pick your favourite. If I see it, have an account, and
care to comment -- I might do so.

### …old content

In the ten years since the Hugo version of my site launched, I've done even
deeper house-cleaning. I will attempt to make sure that changed URLs for
existing content are properly redirected, but I make no promises. Content that I
have removed without replacement will typically redirect right here to explain
that it's gone and isn't coming back.

As noted, some things have been dropped without replacement -- they either said
nothing worthwhile, are severely out of date with no historical value, responded
to something no longer available, or uses a tone or takes a position that I feel
inappropriate today. In other cases, multiple posts have been converted to a
single post. There are partial features from the Hugo site (series and projects)
that are not implemented and no effort will be expended to support those URLs.

Even on this new site, not all pages will be stable -- but those will mostly be
metadata pages (collection index pagination, tag pages, etc.).

Where possible, when I have _updated_ articles, I have attempted to ensure that
this is reflected.

## …other services

I can also be found elsewhere.

[^immigrant]: I am an immigrant to Canada, having emigrated from the United
    States of America in 1998.

[^shipped]: That is, the software was made available for use by people other
    than myself. I consider other people using build scripts that I have written
    having shipped those scripts, in addition to the obvious cases of deploying
    server software for access or sending installable packages to users.

[^forty]: In my most recent count, I have shipped software in thirty-nine
    primary programming languages (or dialects): [AWK][awk], [Bash][bash],
    [C][c], [C#][csharp], [C++][cpp], [CoffeeScript][coffeescript],
    [Delphi][delphi], [Elixir][elixir], [Fish shell][fish], [Go][golang],
    [Io][iolang], [Java][java], [JavaScript][js], [jq][jq], [Korn shell][ksh],
    [LaTeX][latex], [Lua][lua], [M4][m4], [Objective-C][objc], [PHP][php],
    [PL/SQL][oracle-plsql], [PL/pgSQL][plpgsql], [Pascal][pascal], [Perl][perl],
    [Pro\*C][oracle-proc], [Python][python], [REXX][rexx], [Ruby][ruby],
    [Rust][rust], [Solidity][solidity], [Swift][swift], [Tcl][tcl],
    [TypeScript][typescript], [Vim script][vimscript] (including Vim9 script),
    [Visual Basic][vb], [Visual Basic for Applications][vba],
    [Windows Batch files][windows-batch] (both `command.com` and `cmd.exe`), and
    [zsh][zsh].

    I've also shipped software using an additional seven quasi-programming
    languages: [Ansible][ansible] (scripting with [YAML][yaml] and
    [Jinja][jinja]), [Chezmoi][chezmoi] (scripting with Go templates),
    [GitHub Actions][gha] (scripting with [YAML][yaml]), [HCL][hcl],
    [Puppet][puppet] (a Ruby DSL), [SQL][sql], [XSL][xsl], and even
    [WordPerfect][wordperfect] macros.

    I consider myself conversant with [Erlang][erlang], [Gleam][gleam],
    [Elm][elm], and [Zig][zig], and reading familiar with [Ada][ada],
    [COBOL][cobol], and [Smalltalk][smalltalk].

[^dialects]: In my mind, a dialect of a programming language is one that is
    fairly similar to another programming language. As an example, I mention the
    various Unix shells I have used. They're all related to the original Bourne
    shell (except for `tcsh` and `fish`), but there are features in `ksh` that
    do not exist in `bash` and vice-versa. `zsh` tends to have all the features,
    but it is possible to write software in `zsh` that could not run in `bash`
    without changes.
